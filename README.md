## Visa Token Service Virtual Experience Program

The following project focuses on the application and studies of API's offered by Visa and the application of the mentioned. During this program, I recieved the opportunity to step into the shoes of a Visa team member and complete tasks that replicate the work that the Visa software development team does every day. I learned how to confirm the validity of an incoming Visa transaction request and determine how Visa APIs solve an array of cardholders' matters. Moreover, I got the opportunity to comprehend real-time case studies and discover which API's would be deemed best.
