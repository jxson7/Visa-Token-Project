# Case Study and Review Outcome

As part of the following project, I have decided to pursue Case Study 4, whereby the following is presented:

## Case Study 4 Statement

"Even after providing clients with cleaner merchant names, your financial institution still receives disputes of valid transactions. To reduce the rates of disputes, youâ€™d like to provide customers with a way to retrieve additional information about their purchases."

### Selection of API and Reasoning

Following the reviewal of the APIs offered by VISA, the following were selected based upon their appropriateness to the product and the mission statement presented. To commence, to support the user who wishes to further query purchases made, the Merchant Search API would be deemed appropriate for this task. The API offers clientele, namely the customer or VISA to identify data via a merchant name, country code and other elementary attributes. by doing so, further records can be extracted matching the said criteria. Likewise, the API is available on a global scale, regions including North America, and Europe, Asia, CEMEA having limited functionality. 

Additionally, other APIs that can be successfully integrated as part of the project include the Merchant Locator. Merchant Locator API may be one also deemed of functionality and use as it would provide firms and financial institutions with further clarity if a purchase was made by a customer from a certain branch, supporting data integrity and clarity in the manner of accuracy. This data once again can be shared with the client as a form of support and once again, clarity. 

By inserting and implementing the mentioned API functionality, the above mission statement would be adhered to and thus successful. This would be achieved by providing customers and clientele additional information about purchases and supporting the financial institution with further clarity on purchases, thereby validating the details with further verification.
